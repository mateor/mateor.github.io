## NORA

I co-authored a paper last year that was recently presented at the [29th AAAI](http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai15.php) (Association for the Advancement
 of Artificial Intelligence) conference in Austin the weekend of 1/28/15.
 Depending on what I choose to do this year, it may be the only computer sciecce paper
I have any part in.

The project was a collaboration with some really great engineers and researchers. I was
by far the smallest part of it but I was proud of the work I contributed.

The project measures the noise level of rotorcraft flight patterns. From the abstract:

> *"We introduce a system, called NORA (Noise
>  Optimization for Rotorcraft Approach) that allows for the computation
>  of trajectories that simultaneously solve for acoustically
>  quiet patterns that also avoid land sensitive areas."*
